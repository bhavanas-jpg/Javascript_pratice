/**Strings in Javascript */
//1. Strings are texts, which are under single , double, back-tick quote. 
//2. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote.

//ex:
let job = 'teacher'
let quote = "The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020."
let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.`
