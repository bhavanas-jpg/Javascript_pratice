/**Strings in Javascript */
//1. Strings are texts, which are under single , double, back-tick quote. 
//2. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote.

//ex:
let job = 'teacher'
let quote = "The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020."
let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.`

//Long Literal Strings
/**If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line. We can use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line.  */
//Ex:
const paragraph = "My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\
I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\
Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge and \
I hope you are enjoying too."

console.log(paragraph);

//Escape Sequences in Strings
/**In JavaScript and other programming languages \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters:

\n: new line
\t: Tab, means 8 spaces
\\: Back slash
\': Single quote (')
\": Double quote (")

*/
//Ex:
console.log('I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.\nDo you ?') // line break
console.log('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
console.log('Day 1\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 2\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 3\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 4\t3\t5')
console.log('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') // To write a backslash
console.log('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')
console.log("In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'")
console.log('The saying \'Seeing is Believing\' isn\'t correct in 2020')

//Template Literals (Template Strings)
// To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.
//Ex: `String literal text ${expression}`


/**Using a string template or string interpolation method, we can add expressions, which could be a value, or some operations (comparison, arithmetic operations, ternary operation). */

let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}: ${a > b}`)
